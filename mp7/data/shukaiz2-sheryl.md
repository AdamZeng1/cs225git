Sheryl Sandberg had a long day at work. She didn't see Mark Zuckerberg for quite a few days. Because of the series of events recently, she thought Mark is probably traveling around the country so she didn't pay much attention to it. Now finally the day is over, she begins to think whether she should go home, or go to her favorite restaurant in Menlo Park, or go take a break at lounge in Facebook Headquarter before she decides what to do next.
